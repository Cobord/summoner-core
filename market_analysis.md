# Internet of AI agents

NANDA?
- future of ai agent = apple store of agents?

## Decentralized Data Markets: Foundations for a New AI Economy
_Talk by Anna Kazlauskas, Creator of Vana & CEO, Open Data Labs_

vana protocol?
opendata lab -> vana protocol
decentralized data market

what is the market failure around data (ai wolrd)?

Interviewee:

- decentralized / ethereum / crypto 
trusting node -> give power back to user
tomorrow (more technical) 4:30pm - 5:30pm (MIT media lab)

how do user own their data?
no large scale adaption (checkin and egg problem)
user versus developer

try to solve: market failure around data -> huge market value around data
keys and security.

data = energy for AI
ownership?
- artist
- personal data
- own your own AI bsaed on your data

web3 -> web4 = AI agent?

user preference versus economically profitable?

```quote
Note: traceability in data (blockchain)? FHE
```
perspective: interviewee trained AI on dataset (did not have much data compred to big tech)

data is used in prompts, etc.

data labeling
data collection (data brokers?)
buy data from the 10k users for example

ownership on data = equity in AI
sovereing on data


reddit data IPO: $200M in revenue from data only

cryptographic properties (ownership management)

data token = (reddit karma) --> endorsement (game like score)
karma = post more (working?)


user = data processing
bitcoint = user is their own private bank
vana = user are their own data brokers / bank

data = API

two main nodes:
L1 - validator node (blcokchain not working with private data)

TEE (do they use FHE?)
TTE => data validator: can certain operations be run on the operator / should the operation be run

data not legitimate / not contributing => they have a score

Vana + flour = decentralized data + distributed ai

people asking about data as a financial asset: index fund around data?

Ethereum ecosystem ->keep an out on how it evolves

## Networked Agents and Decentralized AI (NANDA): Opportunities for Startups and Investors
_â€‹Presentation by Ramesh Raskar, Professor, MIT and Chris Pease, MIT Media Lab_

1B agents talking to 1B agents.

nanda:

MCPs (anthropic) 

A2A (google) TCP (we need to do much more than that)

Nanda (DNS and architecture)
- MCP have their own proptocol
- will release more protocol


MAINFRAME TO PC (COMAND LINE)
INTRANET (OFF CHAIN - trusted)
Internet (siloed trustless wisdom)
web : http, html, urls, browser


challenges:
- algorithms: 
- economics model
- competitions but building

inspired by MCP, A2A

Claude desktop + MCP

transaction

DNS type of registry: agents are discoverable


host = claude desktop (can do search and matching)
registry = ID for agents (nanada protocol)
server ?
protocol = A2A

NANDA = protocol (starting from MCP)
---
build on top of it
- certificates (X.509) affirming ID of agents
- coupons: ID of interacting agents: search discovery
- registration: node.register() & ensure one-shot registration of nodes SDK
- SDK for developers

NANDA = registry
---
- search 
- discovery
- ...

NANDA = host
---
it like a browser (need claude key) (Google, Yahoo)
**browser is a chat = give control to AI (not directly controled by humans)**

NANDA = 
---

**Google A2A:**

### Toufi Saliba (CEO, Hypercycle)
1% of people would care about storage / data and decentralization:
makes it hard
"decentralized" < "internet of AI agents"

### Clara Tsao (Director, Filecoin foundation)
Hard time to go through a bank ?
"who pays the most" 
"who has the right consultant"
Turbotax = subscription ? back in the days, you onwed a piece of software
Uploaded intelligence
-> black mirror: uploaded brain and memories, contaminated by ads
we dont own data that we put on AWS (not easily to move to other cloud solutions)
Storage in distribubted network\

how is it different from bots on reddit (reddit = websocket, harder to navigate?)

Motivator:
Decentralized storage aliance? [https://dsalliance.io/](https://dsalliance.io/)
WHat happens if they deconnect the server / service. Where is the data?


### Pei Chen (Executive Director, Theoriq Foundation)
Agent protocl in web3,
crypto, ethereum,
let the agent do all the tasks
Who is gonna drive and control?
Slash / staking

```quote
By definition, staking is a crypto process that allows network participants to earn rewards by locking their coins in wallets. These coins are then used to validate network transactions or as a liquidity source. Staking is applied in networks based on the Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm.
```

decentralization is not the goal but:
- makes network mre secure (no inventor owner) - cannot but shutdown
- level the playing field (allow more people to shine in and dominate on the market)



How is trust created?
---
handshake in protocle (Websocket TCP ?)
