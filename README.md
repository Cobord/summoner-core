> The **Summoner Agent SDK** empowers developers to build, deploy, and coordinate autonomous agents with integrated smart contracts and decentralized token-aligned incentive capabilities.

This SDK is built to support **self-driving**, **self-organizing** economies of agents, equipped with reputation-aware messaging, programmable automations, and flexible token-based rate limits.
