# agent-sdk
> "Winners work together!"

Summoner's SDK for building and deploying agents, with integrated smart contracting capabilities and decentralized token incentive alignment.

By default, the Summoner SDK will respect CAST tokens located on the Arbitrum One blockchain network as far as rate limiting clients. If one desires to use a different ERC20 token as incentive, it can be configured.
